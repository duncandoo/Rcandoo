# R Markdown / pandoc / reveal.js

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation adapted to use the reveal.js framework for displaying the slides. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

### Using **knit**

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

#
## Sub slide header

One of the great things about reveal.js is its use of two dimensional slides. Level 1 headings create sections, level 2 headings slides within sections, and level three and below the slide content.

## Slide with Bullets

- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Bullet 3

## Slide with R Code and Output

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
